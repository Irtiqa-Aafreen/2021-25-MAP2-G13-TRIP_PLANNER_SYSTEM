ðŸ“‹ How to Run the Project
To run the Trip Planner app locally, make sure your system has Node.js (v14 or higher), npm, and the Expo CLI installed. You'll also need a smartphone with the Expo Go app or an emulator (Android Studio or Xcode). After cloning the repository, navigate into the project folder and run npm install to set up dependencies. Then, start the development server using npx expo start. A QR code will appear in the terminalâ€”scan it with the Expo Go app to view the app on your device, or choose to run it on a configured emulator.
